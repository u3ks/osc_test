We implement this by collecting rich metadata. This notebook aims to guide you through this process, and get as much data as possible from you so that we can help you in the best possible way. To process your data we need five things from you:\n",

    " 1. Send us the generated metadata from steps 1., 2. and 5. You can use our self-publishing options (see for the examples/ folder here or [tutorials](https://esa-earthcode.github.io/tutorials/index-2/)) or attach it in the email in step 2.\n",

    "    - confirm that the ESA TO have signded off on your product/project\n",
    "    - confirm the **license for the data product**\n",
