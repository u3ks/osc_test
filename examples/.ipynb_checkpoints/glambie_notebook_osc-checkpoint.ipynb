We implement this by collecting rich metadata. This notebook aims to guide you through this process, and get as much data as possible from you so that we can help you in the best possible way. \n",
    "To process your data and be able to publish it on Open Science Data Catalogue, we need five things from you to get started:\n",

    "1. Information about your ESA (EO Programme) funded Project, \n",
    "2. Infromation about your Product / Dataset\n",
    "3. Infromation about the actual files/data\n",

    "5. Information about the workflow/code you used to generate the data.\n",

    "For steps 1. , 2. , 5. we provide the required parameters and fields in the code cells of this notebook, whcich you need to update with information coming from your project/product/. Step 3. is the most time-consuming, depends a lot on how you plan users to access your data and therefore, we provide you with guides and examples how other ESA projects have done this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once, you provide the inputs, save the notebook locally, and save locally generated metadata files. Then: <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a copy of the Open Science Catalog - locally and create a Pull Request to Publish your data (See `Section 2` at the end of this notebook) **OR** \n",

It supports improved glacier change assessments for climate and sea-level rise research and informs major syntheses such as those used in IPCC reports. The results of the first GlaMBIE phase (2022-24) are published in Nature in 2025: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08545-z.

The project originated under the European Space Agency’s Polar Science Cluster and is fully open to international participation. The consortium organizes calls for data and community participation, and leads the analysis and integration of submitted glacier mass-balance data.The Scientific Advisory Committee provides strategic scientific guidance for GlaMBIE. It is composed of leading scientists with expertise across the key measurement techniques and observation methods used in glacier mass balance assessment. This committee helps ensure methodological rigor and broad representation of the different observational approaches. The Stakeholder Board offers feedback on GlaMBIE products and outcomes from the perspective of partner and user organizations. Members include representatives from potential partner groups and major users of glacier mass balance data - such as international scientific initiatives and climate assessment bodies - helping align GlaMBIE outputs with broader scientific and policy needs.\"\n",

The repository provides access to data, workflows, experiments and documentation from ESA Projects organised across Collections, accessible via the [STAC API](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-api-spec). <br>\n",

This is the most time-consuming step. There are multiple strategies for doing this, we are flexible and it is up to you to decide how to do it, so long as the data conforms to standard STAC specification.<br> **The main consideration should be usability of the data!**.<br>\n",

If you have more than 1 file, you have to extract the metadata for each. The code does not generalise fully, so we only offer a few libraries and pointers to get you started. \n",
