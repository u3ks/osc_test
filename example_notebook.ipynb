We implement this by collecting rich metadata. This notebook aims to guide you through this process, and get as much data as possible from you so that we can help you in the best possible way. To process your data we need five things from you:\n",

    "5. Infromation about the workflow/code you used to generate the data.\n",

    " 1. Open a pull request using the publishing options:\n",
